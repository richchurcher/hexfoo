Template for creating projects dual-licensed under both MIT and Apache 2.0

under both MIT and Apache 2.0 license. This would help in taking advantage of
the patent clause of Apache 2.0 License, without preventing their usage with
projects licensed under GPLv2 or other licenses not compatible with Apache 2.0
license.
